# User Stories

A user story helps us achieve a clear separation between what the system does and how it does it.

It is a development tool meant to establish an outside-in perspective on our system, keeping us focused on what matters and helping us avoid over-engineering.


* Describe succinctly and simply WHAT the User wants the software to do.
* Don’t include descriptions of HOW the software will work.
* Come from sharing expertise and perspectives of the different roles in software development.
* Use ‘natural’ language that a non-technical person, and the User, would understand.
* Are deliberately high-level, not fixed in the technical implementation details
* Capture the goal but are vague engough to allow different ways to achieve the goal.

Confirm that the stories work for other solutions (eg web app vs robot app vs voice control)

## Five Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating Requirements as Remote Control Programming

- A user story is a description of the problem we're solving, not a specification of a solution.
- Specifying the solution clamps down on innovation.
- Focusing on the solution instead of the need can detach development teams from the problem they're working on.

### 2. Treating Stories as a Contract for Change

- Writing stories as a detailed definition of a change can hinder collaboration.
- Stories should be simple descriptions, serving as placeholders for a conversation.
- Detailed descriptions should be part of the conversation that comes later.

### 3. Monster Stories

- User stories should intentionally be small, representing a small increment in the behavior of the system.
- Aim to complete a user story within a sprint, or even better, in a day or two.

### 4. "Value" to a User Means "Valuable" to a User

- A treasure is valuable, but a penny has value.
- The idea is to work on things that move the software forward in small, efficient steps, making it easier to understand and backtrack if needed.

### 5. Dependencies Between Stories

- Avoid trying to manipulate the order of stories to optimize the development process.
- Stay focused on delivering value from the user's perspective rather than large, non-essential must-haves.
- Good stories are atomic and can be implemented in any order.
