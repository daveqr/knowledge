## User Stories

A user story helps us achieve a clear separation between what the system does and how it does it.

It is a development tool meant to establish an outside-in perspective on our system, keeping us focused on what matters and helping us avoid over-engineering.

## Five Common Mistakes

### 1. Treating Requirements as Remote Control Programming

- A user story is a description of the problem we're solving, not a specification of a solution.
- Specifying the solution clamps down on innovation.
- Focusing on the solution instead of the need can detach development teams from the problem they're working on.

### 2. Treating Stories as a Contract for Change

- Writing stories as a detailed definition of a change can hinder collaboration.
- Stories should be simple descriptions, serving as placeholders for a conversation.
- Detailed descriptions should be part of the conversation that comes later.

### 3. Monster Stories

- User stories should intentionally be small, representing a small increment in the behavior of the system.
- Aim to complete a user story within a sprint, or even better, in a day or two.

### 4. "Value" to a User Means "Valuable" to a User

- A treasure is valuable, but a penny has value.
- The idea is to work on things that move the software forward in small, efficient steps, making it easier to understand and backtrack if needed.

### 5. Dependencies Between Stories

- Avoid trying to manipulate the order of stories to optimize the development process.
- Stay focused on delivering value from the user's perspective rather than large, non-essential must-haves.
- Good stories are atomic and can be implemented in any order.
