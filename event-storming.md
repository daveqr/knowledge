# Event-Storming


EventStorming is a collaborative modeling technique that emerged from the domain-driven design (DDD) and agile software development communities. It is designed to facilitate understanding complex business processes and systems through visualizing and exploring events within a domain.

1. **Collaborative Workshop:** EventStorming is typically conducted as a collaborative workshop involving various stakeholders, including domain experts, developers, and other team members. The goal is to bring together people with different perspectives to gain a shared understanding of the domain.

1. **Modeling with Sticky Notes:** The primary tool used in EventStorming workshops is sticky notes. Participants write events, commands, and other relevant information on these notes and then place them on a large whiteboard or workspace. Different colors and shapes of sticky notes may represent different types of information, such as events, commands, aggregates, policies, or actors.

1. **Timeline and Exploration:** EventStorming focuses on creating a timeline of events that occur within the domain. These events represent significant occurrences or changes of state within the system. Participants explore the relationships between events and their order in the timeline to understand how the system behaves.

1. **Aggregates and Bounded Contexts:** In addition to events, EventStorming often involves identifying aggregates and bounded contexts within the domain. Aggregates are clusters of related data and behavior, while bounded contexts define specific subdomains with their own language and rules.

1. **Workshop Phases:** EventStorming workshops typically progress through several phases, including:

	1. **Big Picture EventStorming:** This phase focuses on creating an overview of the domain, identifying high-level events, and understanding the main processes.

	1. **Process Level EventStorming:** In this phase, participants delve deeper into specific processes or scenarios, exploring the interactions and events in more detail.

	1. **Design Level EventStorming:** This phase is concerned with designing the system or software based on the insights gained from the previous phases. It can involve creating aggregates, defining commands, and refining the event model.

1. **Domain-Driven Design Alignment:** EventStorming aligns well with the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), particularly in terms of understanding the business domain, defining bounded contexts, and designing aggregates.

1. **Visual and Collaborative:** EventStorming's visual and collaborative nature makes it an effective tool for knowledge sharing and problem-solving. It helps teams avoid misunderstandings and identify areas of complexity early in the development process.

1. **Iterative and Evolving:** EventStorming is often an iterative process, as the model evolves with the team's understanding of the domain. It can be revisited as the project progresses or as new insights emerge.

1. **Tool Support:** While the core of EventStorming relies on physical sticky notes and whiteboards, there are digital tools available that support online collaboration for distributed teams.
