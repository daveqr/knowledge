# Newton's laws of motion

## First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia):

This law states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force.

## Second Law of Motion (F = ma):

This law relates the force applied to an object (F) to its mass (m) and the resulting acceleration (a).

Mathematically, it is expressed as F = ma, where F is the force in newtons (N), m is the mass in kilograms (kg), and a is the acceleration in meters per second squared (m/s²).

### Example: Accelerating a Car

Suppose you have a car with a mass of 1,000 kilograms (kg), and you apply a constant force of 2,000 newtons (N) to accelerate it. You want to find the resulting acceleration of the car.

Using Newton's Second Law (F = ma), you can calculate the acceleration as follows:

```
F (force) = 2,000 N
m (mass) = 1,000 kg
```

Now, plug these values into the formula: `F = ma`

```
2,000 N = (1,000 kg) * a
```

To find 'a' (acceleration), divide both sides by 1,000 kg:

```
a = (2,000 N) / (1,000 kg)

a = 2 m/s²
```

So, in this example, when you apply a constant force of 2,000 newtons to the car with a mass of 1,000 kilograms, the car will accelerate at a rate of 2 meters per second squared (m/s²). This means its velocity will increase by 2 meters per second for each second that the force is applied, assuming no other forces are acting on the car.


## Third Law of Motion (Action-Reaction):

This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
It is a concept that explains how forces act in pairs, where the force exerted by one object on another is matched by an equal and opposite force exerted by the second object on the first.
